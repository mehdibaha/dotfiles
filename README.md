# ðŸ”¨ dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

Most of the features are targeted to macOS systems, but the dotfiles are fully compatible with Linux-based systems.

## Overview

* Install brew/casks/macOS apps
* Setup settings for macOS and apps (Dock positions, Rectangle)
* Symlink dotfiles (bash_profile, vim, gitconfig...)
* Setup periodic script w/ native launchd (for: backups, cleanups, updates...)

### Packages

* [Recipes](https://brew.sh)
    * **basics**: bash, coreutils, git
    * **utilities**: tree, wget, openssl
    * **binaries**: python, heroku, mongodb
    * **extras**: mas, trash

* [Casks](https://caskroom.github.io) + [macOS apps](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
    * **utilities**: Rectangle
    * **dev stuff**: Docker, VS Code

## Install

Clone the dotfiles with Git:

    git clone https://github.com/mehdibaha/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

**Make sure to read thoroughly the config files**, then:

* If you want to include installation of apps/recipes (common in new computers):

        INSTALL_APPS=1 source ~/.dotfiles/start.sh # in bash terminal

* If you're only making changes to the settings:

        source ~/.dotfiles/start.sh # in bash terminal
