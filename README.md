## Install

Clone the dotfiles with Git:

    git clone https://github.com/mehdibaha/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

**Make sure to read through the config files**, then:

* If you want to include installation of apps/recipes (common in new computers):

        INSTALL_APPS=1 source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

* If you're only making changes to the settings (common for adding :

        source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

## (Bonus) Backup

To configure a backup, add a remote storage and a local remote using:

    rclone config

To verify rclone is set-up properly, run the following command:

    > rclone listremotes
    gdrive: # can be any other storage solution
    local: # this is your locale hard-drive

Finally, add the following line to your launchd script:

    rclone sync --exclude-from $RCLONE_FILTER local:$HOME $RCLONE_REMOTE:$HOSTNAME

Make sure variables are properly set in [settings.sh](macos/settings.sh), then:

    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
